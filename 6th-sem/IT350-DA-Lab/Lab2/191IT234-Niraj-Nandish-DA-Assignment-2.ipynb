        "I generated the different k-shingles specified in the tasks & calculated the Jaccard and Levenshtein distance between the generated k-shingles. The above experiment was also performed for the Indian Language - Kannada. Then I made a function to generate the min-hash signature of the above generated shingles. Min-hashing is the process of compressing generated sets of unique shingles into smaller representations called 'signatures'. Larger the value of hashes(number of permutations), larger the size of the signature and more accurate representation of the shingles. The purpose of using min-hashing is to get a faster approximation of the jaccard distance but it is not completely accurate."
